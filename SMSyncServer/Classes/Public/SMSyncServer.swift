// TODO: When initiating a batch of uploads, e.g., when deploying the SyncServer for the first time to users, we may want to make an overt user interface that asks the users to wait while data is synced with the server. And give them some kind of progress indication so they know how long they will wait.

    // Called at the end of all downloads, on non-error conditions. Only called when there was at least one download.
    // The callee owns the files referenced by the NSURL's after this call completes.

/* [1]. 2/24/16; Up until today, the design for the download delegate provided a callback to the app/client for each single file downloaded. However, that doesn't seem to be the right way to go because of the possibility that downloads will fail part way through. E.g., there could be two files to download and only one gets downloaded successfully at this point in time. This partial download scenario doesn't fit with the atomic/transactional character of the operations we are trying to provide. So I've switched the delegates over to a single callback indicating to the app/client that all downloads have completed.
